# A/B Testing in React Native - Sample App

#### [Read the blog post here](https://configcat.com/blog/)

This is a demo mobile app built with React Native. In the article, it was used in a demo A/B test experiment where variation B was released to 10% of users to gather metrics. In the end, I demoed how to compare the metrics from each variation to determine which is better.
